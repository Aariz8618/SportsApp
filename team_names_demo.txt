🏏 LIVE MATCH TEAM NAMES DEMONSTRATION 🏏

This file shows how the actual team names will be displayed in your SportsApp instead of "Team A" and "Team B":

===========================================
🔧 HOW IT WORKS TECHNICALLY:
===========================================

1. LiveMatch.getTeamAName() returns: teams[0].name (e.g., "India")
2. LiveMatch.getTeamBName() returns: teams[1].name (e.g., "Australia")
3. Only falls back to "Team A"/"Team B" if teams data is missing

✅ LiveMatchAdapter calls these methods:
   - tvTeam1Name.text = "${match.getTeamAFlag()} ${match.getTeamAName()}"
   - tvTeam2Name.text = "${match.getTeamBName()} ${match.getTeamBFlag()}"

✅ LiveMatchRepository provides real team data:
   - From API: teams come from cricket-live-line API
   - From Mock: teams are hardcoded with real names like "India", "Australia"

===========================================
🎯 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
===========================================

✅ LiveMatch model has getTeamAName() and getTeamBName() methods
✅ These methods return actual team names from teams[0].name and teams[1].name
✅ LiveMatchAdapter uses these methods to display team names
✅ LiveMatchRepository mock data has real team names (not "Team A"/"Team B")
✅ MainActivity properly sets up LiveMatch RecyclerView
✅ Fallback system works when no live data is available

===========================================
🚀 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR IN APP:
===========================================

When API works:
→ Shows live matches with real team names from API

When API fails:
→ Shows mock matches with real team names (India, Australia, England, etc.)

When no data at all:
→ Shows original hardcoded match cards as fallback

CONCLUSION: Your app will NEVER show "Team A" and "Team B" unless there's 
a data issue where the teams array is completely empty, which is very unlikely.

The actual team names like "India", "Australia", "England", etc. will be 
displayed with their respective country flags! 🇮🇳🇦🇺🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇳🇿
