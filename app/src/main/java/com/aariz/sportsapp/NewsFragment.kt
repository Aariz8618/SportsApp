In the chase of 178, Tim Seifert (68 off 45) and Johnson Charles (47 off 17) gave the Kings the ideal foundation to complete the chase with ease. Earlier, it was Tabraiz Shamsi who ended with figures of 4-0-17-2, another star performer in Kings' win.

On a good pitch to bat on, the Patriots didn't get off to a flier but were circumspect in their approach with timely boundaries scored by Andre Fletcher. First, off Khary Pierre before hitting four in a row off Keon Gaston but his partner Evin Lewis fell for 18 in the last over of the PowerPlay. Usually, under fire for his strike-rate Mohammad Rizwan hit 10 runs off his first three deliveries in a clear signal of intent.

Fletcher found the stands after the PowerPlay but was dismissed off Shamsi's first ball of the night. The scoring rate slowed down as the troika of spinners - Shamsi, Roston Chase and Pierre - kept it very tight. But, Oshane Thomas' struggles in CPL 2025 continued as he conceded 22 runs in his first over which included two sixes, a four and four wides. Kyle Mayers, who had struggled all night up to this point, bludgeoned two sixes and scored a timely boundary to finally find some momentum. He didn't last long though as he fell in the next over to Shamsi but Rizwan moved to 50 off 35 balls.

Jason Holder powered two sixes while Rizwan added another before a leaky final over from Gaston yielded 15 runs for the Patriots. The Kings bowlers were once again at fault for bowling too many extras in a 15-run final over as the Patriots ended on 177 for 3.

The pitch got better to bat on as the night wore on which fit perfectly for Seifert and Charles. The openers were aggressive from ball one, especially Charles who smashed 18 runs off Mayers' second over. Seifert joined in the action against Navian Bidaisee in the fifth over going 6,4,6 before Charles rounded off the over with a boundary. Charles continued to motor on with boundaries as the Kings ended the PowerPlay on 72 for 0.

The Kings onslaught continued with Waqar Salamkheil hit for back-to-back sixes by Charles. The batter tried to muscle one six too many as he fell against the run of play for 47. Ackeem Auguste on the back of a 73 in the last game smashed his fifth delivery for six after the wicket. Seifert continued to pick up boundaries as the Kings moved past 100 with the Kiwi opener bringing up fifty. Auguste, who was playing the perfect foil for Seifert, hit back-to-back boundaries off Holder before adding a third off Bidaisee in the next over to bring up the 50-run stand between the two. Auguste and Seifert departed within two overs of each other but only after the equation was brought down to 22 off the last five overs.

Tim David and Chase then found the boundary twice to seal a comfortable win for the Kings. Meanwhile, the Patriots have now suffered their fifth loss of the season in seven games."""

Doriga appeared before the Magistate's court on Wednesday morning, and is understood to have pled guilty to the charges.

But here's a stat to startle - Stubbs, who is among the most athletic and electrifying fielders in world cricket, has dropped six catches in his last five games.

What's up with him?

"These guys play a lot of cricket, especially the ones who play all three formats," Ashwell Prince, South Africa's batting coach, told a press conference on Thursday (August 28). "Sometimes you can get a little bit clouded in terms of your approach and how to go about things.

"Stubbs first came onto the domestic scene as predominantly a white-ball player. We've always felt that he's a good batter, not just a good white-ball batter, and that he can play all the formats.

"When you're dipping in between formats and you have different approaches, sometimes you're in a white-ball series where you want to play a more natural game and maybe your mindset is not as free as you would like it to be.

"I think Tristan is probably in that mental space at the moment. We're having the conversations to try and encourage him to be a little bit freer, to be a little bit more positive, to be the guy who burst onto the scene."

Doubtless Prince's conversations with Breetzke are starkly different.

"When you have a bit of form, your confidence is up. There's a lot more clarity in what you want to do.

"I've been impressed with the intensity of his training. We were joking with him in training before the ODI series that he's got to put that bat on ice because it was smashing it. It's great to see a player transform that sort of training form into how he plays in matches. and go and play."""
